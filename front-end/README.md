# Programming Language Voting System

This project aims to create a web application that allows users to vote for their favorite programming language. The application consists of a front-end and a back-end.

## Front-end

The front-end of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user interface where users can view the programming languages and vote for their favorite one. The front-end communicates with the back-end using HTTP requests.

To set up the front-end, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: \`git clone <repository URL>\`
2. Navigate to the front-end directory: \`cd front-end\`
3. start a live server extention
4. Access the front-end in your browser

## Back-end

The back-end of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides the necessary APIs to handle voting and store the votes in a database. The back-end communicates with the front-end by receiving HTTP requests and sending JSON responses.

To set up the back-end, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: \`git clone <repository URL>\`
2. Navigate to the back-end directory: \`cd back-end\`
3. Install the dependencies: \`npm install\`
4. Configure the database connection in and start server from mongod server.
5. Start the server: \`npm start\`
6. The back-end will be running at: \`http://localhost:3000\`
