# Programming Language Voting System

This project aims to create a web application that allows users to vote for their favorite programming language. The application consists of a front-end and a back-end.

## Front-end

The front-end of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user interface where users can view the programming languages and vote for their favorite one. The front-end communicates with the back-end using HTTP requests.

To set up the front-end, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository URL>`
2. Navigate to the front-end directory: `cd front-end`
3. Start a live server extension .
   3.1 Live Server Extension: If you are using a code editor like Visual Studio Code, you can use the "Live Server" extension to quickly launch a development server. Here's how to do it:
   - Install the "Live Server" extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
   - Open the HTML file `register.html ` of your front-end code in Visual Studio Code.
   - Right-click anywhere in the HTML file and select "Open with Live Server". This will launch a local development server and open the HTML file in your default web browser.

## Back-end

The back-end of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides the necessary APIs to handle voting and store the votes in a database. The back-end communicates with the front-end by receiving HTTP requests and sending JSON responses.

To set up the back-end, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository URL>`
2. Navigate to the back-end directory: `cd back-end`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Download and install MongoDB from the official website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

   4.1 check the package is msi
   4.2 can follow this link to setup https://medium.com/@LondonAppBrewery/how-to-download-install-mongodb-on-windows-4ee4b3493514
5. Start the MongoDB server.
6. Configure the database connection in the back-end code to connect to your locally running MongoDB instance.
7. Start the server: `npm run start`
8. The back-end will be running at: `http://localhost:3000`
